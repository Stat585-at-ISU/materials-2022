## Example: the gapminder project

Part of a quantitative world is our responsibility to make data accessible

- Hans Rosling (2017✝) was at the fore-front of providing World Health Statistics (gapminder)

- in R through the package `gapminder` by Jenny Bryan

- Hans Rosling's [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en)

## First Look: US only

```{r}
library(gapminder)

gapminder %>% filter(country == "United States") %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = year, y =lifeExp)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
```

How would you describe this plot?

---

## First Model: US only

```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(country == "United States") %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = year, y =lifeExp)) + geom_line() + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)
```

---

## Model of the US

```{r warning = FALSE}
lm(lifeExp~I(year-1950), data = filter(gapminder, country == "United States"))
```

---
class: inverse
## Your turn:  another country

Pick another country in the gapminder data and derive estimates. 

How do the estimates compare to the US?

---

## All countries

```{r, fig.height = 4}
gapminder %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = year, y =lifeExp)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country, colour=continent)) 
```

--

Most  countries show an increase in life expectancy over time, but not all

--

We would like to group similar countries 


---

## All countries - interactively

```{r, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
gg <- gapminder %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = year, y =lifeExp)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country, colour=continent)) 
plotly::ggplotly(gg)
```

---

## Using models as exploratory tools

Now we would like to repeat this modelling approach to all countries, i.e. 

- *split* by country, 

- *apply* the model, 

- *combine* the results. 

But we certainly don't want to subset the data for every country ... 

---

## First approach

```{r}
gapminderplus <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(year = year - 1950) %>% 
  summarize(
    intercept = coef(lm(lifeExp ~ year))[1],
    slope = coef(lm(lifeExp ~ year))[2]
  )
```

---

```{r}
gapminderplus %>% ggplot(aes(x = intercept, y = slope)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---

```{r}
gapminderplus %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = intercept, y = slope)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = country), 
            data = filter(gapminderplus, slope < 0),
            nudge_y = 0.035)
```

---

## Cons: First approach

- double evaluation of the model is bad

- what if we want to get additional values from the model, such as $R^2$?

- what if we want to get additional values from the data, such as continent?

```{r}
gapminderplus <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(year = year - 1950) %>% 
  summarize(
    model = coef(lm(lifeExp ~ year))[1],
    slope = coef(lm(lifeExp ~ year))[2]
  )
```

---

# List variables

one step into the right direction is the use of list variables:

```{r}
gapminderplus <- gapminder %>% 
   group_by(country) %>%
   mutate(year = year - 1950) %>% 
   summarize(
     model = list(lm(lifeExp ~ year))
   )

gapminderplus
```

---

## Split-Apply-Combine for lists


- `nest` creates list of data frames (split)

- `map` applies function to list object (apply)

- `unnest` moves list results back into a data frame (combine)


---

## nest

- `nest` is a function in `tidyr`: creates variable `data`

- `data` is (list) variable of data frames

```{r}
countryList <- gapminder %>% mutate(year = year-1950) %>% 
  nest(-country, -continent) 
countryList 
```


---

## Nested data frames

Each element of the `data` variable in `countryList` is a dataset:

```{r}
countryList$data[[10]] %>% arrange(year)
```

---
class: inverse
## Your Turn

Find the data for Canada from `countryList`

Why does `countryList$data[[countryList$country=="Canada"]]` not work?

---

## Nested data frames (cont'd)

We can use the list elements as data inputs:

```{r}
lm(lifeExp~year, data=countryList$data[[10]])
```


---
class: inverse
## Your Turn (8 mins) 


The goal of this your turn is for you to try out nesting operations on various datasets.

- Nest the `ChickWeight` data in different ways: what are the results of 

```
ChickWeight %>% nest(-Diet)
ChickWeight %>% nest(weight)
ChickWeight %>% nest(Time, weight)
```

- `chickwts` is yet another data set on feeding chicks. Nest it by different feeds. 

- `nest` respects grouping structure introduced by `group_by`. Use `group_by` to nest the `iris` dataset by species. 


---

## Fitting multiple models

Now we are using the `map` function in the package `purrr`.

`map` allows us to apply a function to each element of a list.


```{r}
myfit <- function (dframe) {
  lm(lifeExp ~ year, data = dframe)
}

countryList <- countryList %>% mutate(
    model = purrr::map(data, myfit)
)
head(countryList)
```

---

## Fitting multiple models - Alternative

`map` allows us to use a formula instead of a function (creates anonymous function on the fly):

`countryList` is now essentially the same object as `gapminderplus`


```{r}
countryList <- countryList %>% mutate(
    model = purrr::map(data, function(d) lm(lifeExp~year, data = d))
)
head(countryList)
```

---

# Extracting model estimates

```{r}
countryList %>%
  mutate(
    intercept = model %>% purrr::map_dbl(.f = function(m) coef(m)[1]),
    slope = model %>% purrr::map_dbl(.f = function(m) coef(m)[2])
  ) %>% head(5)
```
... bit complicated?

---

## The broom package

Now we have all these models ... 

<img src="images/broom.jpeg" class="cover" width=1000>


---

## The `broom` package

`broom` allows to extract values from models on three levels:

- for each model: `broom::glance`

- for each coefficient in the model: `broom::tidy`

- for each value in the dataset: `broom::augment`

--

```{r}
library(broom)
broom::glance(countryList$model[[1]])
```

---

```{r}
broom::tidy(countryList$model[[1]])
```

---

```{r}
broom::augment(countryList$model[[1]])
```

---

##Extract values for each coefficient

Extract coefficients for all countries automatically (hello `map` again!)

```{r}
# works, but we lose the context
coefs = countryList$model %>% purrr::map(.f=broom::tidy)
head(coefs)
```

---

##Extract values for each coefficient (cont'd)

```{r}
# better, but everything is still stuffed into this strange format
countryList <- countryList %>% mutate(
  coefs = model %>% purrr::map(.f=broom::tidy)
) 
countryList %>% head()
```

---

## Ready to fly!

The opposite of `nest` is `unnest`:

```{r}
coefs <- countryList %>% select(country, continent, coefs) %>% 
  unnest()
coefs
```

---

## Reshaping

```{r fig.width=4.5, fig.height = 4.5}
coefsLong <- coefs %>% pivot_longer(names_to="Statistic", values_to = "Value", 4:7)
coefsTerm <- coefsLong %>% pivot_wider(names_from="term", values_from="Value")
coefsTerm %>% filter(Statistic == "estimate") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = `(Intercept)`, y = year)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = continent)) + ylab("Slope (year)")
```


---
class: inverse
## Your turn (10 mins)

- Extract other model diagnostics: find the R square value for each model. Draw a visualization of R square by country - can you see a pattern? What does the pattern mean?

- Extract residuals and fitted values for each of the models and store them in a dataset together with country and continent information. 

- Plot residuals across the years and fit a smooth. What does the pattern mean?

- Include predicted Life Expectancy for 2017 into the data set. Then compare predicted life expectancy in 2017 with that in 1950.
