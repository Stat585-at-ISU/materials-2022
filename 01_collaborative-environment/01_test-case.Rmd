# Tools for collaborating in teams

## A test case

The dataset `brfss_iowa.csv` (linked from website) contains 6227 records from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for Iowans.

> The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nation's premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors.

It is conducted annually by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Codebook with detailed explanations of variables is [available here](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2015/pdf/codebook15_llcp.pdf).

## Your turn

You are asked to investigate the relationship between height and weight of Iowans based on the 2015 BRFSS records (see course website for data).

In the next 20 mins:

0. Complete the following tasks and **write instructions / documentation** for a collaborator to be able to reproduce your findings.

1. Verify that there are 6227 cases (= number of interviews) in the data. 

2. Verify that there are variables `WEIGHT2` and `HEIGHT3` in the data and read the description of the variables in the codebook. 

3. How are height and weight related? Find correlations of weight and height by gender (`SEX`). How many values are the correlations based on for each gender?

2. Write a short report of your findings. Address potential problems in the data.

## Your turn

In the next 10 mins:

1. Introduce yourself to your neighbor. 

2. Swap the report and the instructions / documentation with your collaborator - **BUT DO NOT TALK ABOUT THE DATA OR THE ANALYSIS** (yet)

3. Try to reproduce your neighbor's findings. 


Thanks to  Jenny Bryan and Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel for the idea for the original  example!

## How did that go? 

![](images/desperation-0.jpg)


- Where did things get problematic?

---

## Reflection

- What tools did you use?

- Were you successful in reproducing each others' work? 
<br><br>


- What would happen if your collaborator is no longer available to walk you through 
their analysis?

- What made it easy / hard for reproducing your partners' work?

- What would have to happen if 
    - you had to swap out the dataset or extend the analysis further?
    - you caught further data errors and had to re-create the analysis
    with corrections?
    - you had to revert back to the original dataset?

## Summary

- Everyone struggles with reproducibility and it is a hindrance to moving 
science forward

- Even with a fairly simple analysis challenges were faced in four main areas:
organization, documentation, automation, and dissemination

# Facets of reproducibility

---

## Four facets of reproducibility

1. **Documentation:** difference between binary files (e.g. docx) and text files and
why text files are preferred for documentation
    - *Protip:* Use markdown to document your workflow so that anyone can pick up your
    data and follow what you are doing
    - *Protip:* Use literate programming so that your analysis and your results are
    tightly connected, or better yet, unseparable

2. **Organization:** tools to organize your projects so that you don't have a single 
folder with hundreds of files

3. **Automation:** the power of scripting to create automated data analyses

4. **Dissemination:** publishing is not the end of your analysis, rather it is a way 
station towards your future research and the future research of others
