# Solution to the test case 

---

## A test case

The dataset `brfss_iowa.csv` (linked from website) contains 6227 records from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for Iowans.

> The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nation's premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors.

It is conducted annually by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Codebook with detailed explanations of variables is [available here](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2015/pdf/codebook15_llcp.pdf).

## The Problem

0. Complete the following tasks and **write instructions / documentation** for a collaborator to be able to reproduce your findings.

1. Verify that there are 6227 cases (= number of interviews) in the data. 

2. Verify that there are variables `WEIGHT2` and `HEIGHT3` in the data and read the description of the variables in the codebook. 

3. How are height and weight related? Find correlations of weight and height by gender (`SEX`). How many values are the correlations based on for each gender?

2. Write a short report of your findings. Address potential problems in the data.

# A solution attempt

0. Setup 

    - this solution uses R v4.0.5 in RStudio (2021.09.1 Build 372). 
    - You need the R packages `tidyverse` and `rmarkdown` to run the solution
    - use the command `install.packages(c("tidyverse","rmarkdown"))` 
    in the R console to install the two packages

1. Navigate to https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/materials-2022

2. Download  the file [`test-case-solution.Rmd`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stat585-at-ISU/materials-2022/master/01_collaborative-environment/test-case-solution.Rmd) in folder  `01_collaborative-environment`  in RStudio to get this set of slides.

3. "Knit" the file (Click on the button in the menu).

## What is the relationship between height and weight? 

Read the data: 

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
iowa <- readr::read_csv("https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/materials/raw/master/01_collaborative-environment/data/brfss_iowa.csv") 
# the read_csv function from the readr package is faster than the standard read.csv
# but the output is a tibble (we'll come back to that)

iowa
```

---

## Variables `HEIGHT3` and `WEIGHT2`

```{r, message = FALSE}
iowa %>% select(HEIGHT3, WEIGHT2) %>% head()
```

Variables are there ... but ... some data values look odd.

---

## Codebook excerpt

From the [codebook](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2015/pdf/codebook15_llcp.pdf): HEIGHT3 and WEIGHT2 are the originally recorded variables.

<img src="https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/materials/raw/master/01_collaborative-environment/images/codebook-height3.png" width=750>

Let's plot that ...

---

## Plot 

Load the `ggplot2` package to plot weight versus height:
```{r message = FALSE, fig.width=3.5, fig.height = 3.5, warning = FALSE}
iowa %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = WEIGHT2, y = HEIGHT3)) + geom_point()
```

Height and weight should show a somewhat positive correlation. These clusters are an indication of the data coding.

---

## Next steps

Obviously, we need to spend some time cleaning these variables before we can make use of them. 

We have a couple of choices: 

1. We can buckle down and do that clean-up and then move on to the calculation.

2. We can take another look at the variables and investigate what `HTIN4`, `HTM4`, and `WTKG3` are ... 

---

## Route 2

Let's take the second route first and draw a picture of height and weight in metric units:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 5.5, fig.height = 2.5}
iowa %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = HTM4, y = WTKG3)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  facet_grid(.~SEX) +
  geom_smooth()
```

These charts look much better! We see a general increase in weight as height increases. The variability in weight is huge, though. On average, women (`SEX = 2`) are shorter and lighter.

---

## Correlations of height and weight by gender

Based on variables `HTM4` and `WTKG3`

```{r}
iowa %>% 
  group_by(SEX) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    cor = cor(HTM4, WTKG3, use="pairwise.complete"),
    non_missing = sum(!is.na(HTM4) & !is.na(WTKG3)),
    non_missing_perc = non_missing/n*100
  )

```


---

## Route 1

This is a bit more work. 

```{r}
# first of all, replace all missing values by NAs
iowa <- iowa %>% mutate(
  HEIGHT3 = replace(HEIGHT3, HEIGHT3 %in% c(7777,9999), NA),
  WEIGHT2 = replace(WEIGHT2, WEIGHT2 %in% c(7777,9999), NA)
)
```

Let's take on height first:
```{r}
iowa <- iowa %>% mutate(
  feet = HEIGHT3 %/% 100, # feet and inch only make sense for standard values,
  inch = HEIGHT3 %% 100,  # but we can calculated them for all
  height = ifelse(HEIGHT3 >= 9000, 
                  HEIGHT3 - 9000, # transform all metric values by subtracting 9000
                  feet *30.48 + 2.54*inch # add feet and inch converted to centimeter
                  )
)
```

---

## Now plot!

```{r, fig.height = 5}
iowa %>% filter(!is.na(height)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2.5) +
  facet_grid(SEX~.)
```

We get similar findings - for height at least: women are on average shorter than men.

---

## Route 1 (cont'd.)

do the same thing for weight as we did for height before: 1 pound is 0.454 kg

```{r}
iowa <- iowa %>% mutate(
  weight = ifelse(WEIGHT2 >= 9000, 
                  WEIGHT2 - 9000, # transform all metric values by subtracting 9000
                  WEIGHT2*.454 # 1 lbs = 0.454 kg
                  )
)
```

---

## Route 1

```{r warning = FALSE}
iowa %>% 
  group_by(SEX) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    cor = cor(height, weight, use="pairwise.complete"),
    non_missing = sum(!is.na(height) & !is.na(weight)),
    non_missing_perc = non_missing/n*100
  )
```

---

## Recap 

- Route 1 and 2 give identical solutions

- Read the codebook, visualize the data, even if the question does not ask for it.


```{r}
iowa %>% 
  group_by(SEX) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    cor = cor(HEIGHT3, WEIGHT2, use="pairwise.complete"),
    non_missing = sum(!is.na(HEIGHT3) & !is.na(WEIGHT2)),
    non_missing_perc = non_missing/n*100
  )
```


---

## Overview of the different height variables

```{r}
summary(iowa[,c("HEIGHT3", "HTIN4", "HTM4", "height")])
```

Why are there more missing values in `HTIN4`? - The official BRFSS data is missing any metric data in the variable `HTIN4`
