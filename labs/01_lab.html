# Lab Assignment #1
### Heike Hofmann

---


# How this is going to work

1. Find your team

2. You are asked to work through a set of questions 

3. The deliverable is a final push to your github repository and (in Canvas) an upload of the link to your repository. Don't forget that ALL of the team members should contribute to the repo :)

---

# Agenda for today

1. Link RStudio and git

2. Build a book

3. Deal with the weather (stations) ...

4. ... and some funny file formats

---

# Repo for the lab

1. Accept the link to the github classroom assignment (sent by email). 

2. Check whether one of your team members has already created a team. In that case, join them. If none of your team members is listed yet, create a team.

3. Link the repository to RStudio ... (see next set of slides)

# Connecting RStudio and git

Work through [chapter 12](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html#rstudio-git-github) of Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git with R"

Use your lab's repository as the example repository in RStudio. 


Add a link to the lab repository in your write-up.

# Building a book

---

## Building a book

The goal of this  part of the lab is to build the html version of the 2nd edition for Hadley Wickham's book `Advanced R Programming` from a github repository.

Steps:

1. Clone the repository `https://github.com/hadley/adv-r`.
2. Open the R project in the repository in RStudio.
3. Activate the `Build` tab (by default in the top right panel). Click on the `Build Book` button.
4. The book will be available in html format as index.html

Deliverable (1): what is the last word in chapter 15? - You don't have to answer this question, if things don't work, but please answer the next one and see the next page.

Deliverable (2): Write a paragraph on the biggest problem you encountered when you were building the book, and how you managed to solve it.

---

## What to do when things don't work?

Errors happen, they are frustrating, but if we learn something from them, we can turn them into valuable experiences.

- check the Questions and Answers forum in Canvas whether there is a solution available for your problem. 

- if the above document does (not yet) include your question, document the error you encounter (be as concise and specific as you can at the same time)

- if the Question and Answers forum does (not yet) include a solution, describe one approach on how you tried to solve the problem (and how this did not work).

- submit the description of your problem in Canvas at Discussions &gt; Questions and Answers.  Write the paragraph in the mindset that you want to get help from somebody, and you try to describe the problem you are encountering. 

- Extra points (2.5 pts for the first suggested working solution): post a solution to one of the problems in the Questions and Answers forum (your own or a team member's question does not count!).

# Weather stations

---

## US weather stations


The National Climate Data Center at NOAA publishes information on temperature and precipation across a network of stations in the US.

The Data can be accessed through via https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2.5/, a code book with a description of the data structure is available at
https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2.5/readme.txt

1. Download a copy of the file `ushcn-v2.5-stations.txt`.

2. Make yourself familar with the command `read_fwf` from package `readr`. 

3. Use the codebook description for the stations file, extract all columns and bring them into the intended format (i.e. numbers are numbers)

4. Create a plot with `ggplot2` to show latitude, longitude and elevation. Can you also include state information and time zone?

5. Deliverable: include the code necessary to read the file and to create the plot in `README.Rmd`. Also include the file `ushcn-v2.5-stations.txt` to your repository. 


---

# More weather data

The file `ushcn.tavg.latest.raw.tar.gz`
at ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2.5 contains data on average temperatures across the US. 

1. Download the file and get it to open with tools available in R. (Double-clicking is cheating! :) )

2. Determine how many files are contained inside `ushcn.tavg.latest.raw.tar.gz` and the name of the file containing the temperature data of your home towns or Fort Dodge, IA (please specify).

3. Deliverable: In the Rmarkdown file include the code necessary to extract files from the archive `ushcn.tavg.latest.raw.tar.gz`. Include code to answer the above questions.

If things don't work write a paragraph on why things do not work and what you have tried.
